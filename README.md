# DangerZone
A new IOS/Android game that involves keeping shapes inside the Danger Zone without letting them escape prematurely. Made with the Phaser.io libray.
This game belongs to its creator, Brandon Loehle. My game/code may only be used for private purposes. For instance, seeing an example of a game made with the Javascript library of Phaser.io. Any redistribution of my game for commercial or monetary purposes is strictly prohibited.
